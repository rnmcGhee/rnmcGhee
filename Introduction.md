Part 1: how to utilize Github Copilot
Part 2: set up GC and VS Code

GC purpose is to suggest lines and blocks of code, reducing time/effort of coding. My useful than Chat GPT because it suggests (auto-completes) while you code. 
Examples:
  #drop duplicate from the NPI column 
  (will include the suggestion. keep in mind that it is not perfect so you might have to alter the code slightly)
 
  #Count number of NPI in each Graduation year after 2000
  #plot the results
  (There are no suggestions on this due to a lack of specificity)
  :df_count=

  #Table X: Unexplained Average Gender Wage Gap 

  Do all the code in GH and transfer it to your preferred code, Stata, R, Python, etc.

You need to have all dufiles open simultaneously bc GC is not sophisticated enough yet.

QUESTIONS:  since this is more Stata friendly, do we primarily use Stata for our economic research/ econometrics
            Are we able to look up why a code/function works? If it is recommending a line/block, does it also explain the statistics behind it?
            How to create a text file:
              need to download a text life for windows
              biblatext is for bliographies
